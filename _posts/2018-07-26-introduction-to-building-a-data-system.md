title: "Introduction to Building a Data System"
---

If you were to build an end-to-end data system, from
source to visualization, how would you do it?
Would you use all Microsoft products? All open source?
Would you use a data lake, data warehouse, and data marts?
What about ETL vs. ELT? <!--sep-->

For the past several years, I've mostly worked with just a handful of tools
currently being used in the fields of data analysis, business intelligence, data
engineering , and data science. I've used MS SQL Server for production databases
and data warehouses, SSIS for ETL, Excel for reporting, Tableau for
visualization, and Python for pretty much everything (task automation, tool
building, data analysis, machine learning, ETL, visualization, etc.).

I plan to take the next few months to explore various methods and tools
used to build an end-to-end data system. With each new piece that I
explore, I'll create a post. Some posts will be as simple as, "I installed
product X, using resources A, B, and C." Others will be much more in-depth.

In the end, I hope to have a broader knowledge of different technologies
being used in the industry, as well as, when and why to choose any particular
method over another.

Enjoy!
