  <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Lowery. I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest
    and am currently a Business Intelligence Analyst at Thomson Reuters
    Legal Tracker.</p>
  <p>While I have an expansive range of hobbies and interests, I get the most
    enjoyment out of learning new things. I created this site as a way to
    document what I learn and hopefully help other people along the way.</p>
  <h3>The following are my primary interests:</h2>
  <ol>
  	<li>Python</li>
  	<ul>
  	    <li>Task Automation</li>
  	    <li>Machine Learning</li>
  	    <li>Data Analysis</li>
  	</ul>
  	<li>SQL</li>
  	<li>NoSQL</li>
