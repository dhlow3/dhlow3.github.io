  <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Lowery. I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest
    and am currently a Business Intelligence Analyst at Thomson Reuters
    Legal Tracker.</p>
  <p>While I have an expansive range of hobbies and interests, I get the most
    enjoyment out of learning new things. I created this site as a way to
    document some of my tinkerings and adventures.</p>
